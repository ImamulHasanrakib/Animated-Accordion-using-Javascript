            Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows
            computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being
            explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that enable machines
            to learn patterns and make predictions or decisions based on data
            inputs.

            Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over
            the internet, including storage, processing power, and software
            applications. Cloud computing allows businesses and individuals to
            access computing resources on-demand, rather than maintaining their
            own hardware and software infrastructure.

            Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses
            cryptography to secure and verify transactions and to control the
            creation of new units. It operates independently of a central bank
            and can be used for online purchases or as a store of value.
            Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are examples of cryptocurrencies.
